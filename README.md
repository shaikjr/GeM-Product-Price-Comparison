# GeM-Product-Price-Comparison

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a price comparison solution specifically for comparing the prices of products listed on GeM (Government e-Marketplace) with those available on other popular e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, etc. The solution collects product pricing data using web scraping techniques, APIs, and data analytics, enabling users to compare prices across multiple platforms. The project aims to help users find the most cost-effective options for goods and services, ultimately contributing to efficient procurement decision-making in government operations.
